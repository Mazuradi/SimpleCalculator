Deployment of Windows form applications (.NET framework) using Wix Toolset

1. Pass Task - Deploy sample windoows form app with Wix
2. Credit Task - Deploy custom windows form app (greeting form with web capabilities) with Wix
3. Distinction Task - Deploy simple calculator wiht multiple dependencies using Wix (advanced features enabled)
4. High Distinction Task - Deploy distinction task to the windows store and make it available for sideloading

Comments:
  - Windows store requires active subscription and so the application was not published
  - Sideloading was implemented to show how the app would be deployed to the store (minus a few steps)
